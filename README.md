# Interaction-Design-Lesson-Assigment-3.2

## Goal

Create a warning for users who are looking to delete their account.

### Brief

1. Make an account page where users can manage their account and delete their account. 
2. When they click 'delete account', create a modal asking them whether they are sure they want to delete their account.
3. If they select yes, they should go to a page saying their account has been successfully deleted.

## Level 1 Process

Create two html pages. One for the account page, and one for the 'account deleted' page.
Go to https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp  to see how to use Bootstrap to create a modal.

1. Work with the modal and choose the correct wording to ensure users don't delete their account by accident. Use warning colors, words etc. 
2. The modal should have an option to cancel in case the user changes their mind.
3. Create a link from the 'delete' button to a page where you tell the user they have successfully deleted their account.

Please create a folder of you NAME as I have done. Inside this folder you will have an index.html file, css and img folder to start with. On completion you the system will create an automatic pull request. At the end I should have 1 repo with lots of folders of all your names.
